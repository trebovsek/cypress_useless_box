- [PSoC&trade; 4000S CAPSENSE&trade; prototyping kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-145-40xx) (CY8CKIT-145-40XX)
- [PSoC&trade; 4500S pioneer kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-045S) (CY8CKIT-045S)

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.
